servermain.cpp:
- sendTo(): This function sends a message to another server using UDP. It creates a special structure (sockaddr_in) that holds 
the IP address and port number of the destination, sets it to the localhost (127.0.0.1), and then uses the sendto() system call to send 
the message. It’s used by the main server to send "LIST?" requests to Game Servers A, B, and C and later to send player move 
queries like "QUERY,PlayerName,Column".
- trim(): This function cleans up a string by removing extra spaces, commas, and newline characters from the beginning and end. 
It makes sure every message and user input is clean before being processed.
- split(): This function breaks a string into smaller parts called tokens using a chosen separator, like a comma. For example, the 
string "PLAYERS,Alice,Bob" becomes a list ["PLAYERS", "Alice", "Bob"]. This makes it easy for the program to extract player names or 
response values from messages sent by the game servers.
- main(): This function creates and binds a UDP socket for the main server, sends "LIST?" messages to all game servers, and receives 
the lists of players from each one. After setup, it lets the user type in a player name and column number to drop a token in the game. 
It sends the request to the correct game server, waits for a response, and prints messages like “You successfully dropped a token in 
slot X” or “Column is full.” It keeps running in a loop until the program is closed by Ctrl+C.
- loadFile(): This function reads the local data file and sets up the initial game state for the server. It loads the two player names 
from the first line of the file, then reads the rest of the lines to find how many slots remain in each column. It also counts how many 
moves have been made to decide which player’s turn is next. This function makes sure the server starts with the correct player names, 
board setup, and turn order before handling any messages from the main server.
- main(): This function starts by calling loadFile() to initialize the game data, then creates and binds a UDP socket on the server’s 
assigned port. After that, it enters a loop that continuously listens for messages from the main server. When it receives a message, 
it checks whether it’s a "LIST?" request or a "QUERY" command. It then responds by either sending the list of players or updating the 
game state and sending back the result of a move.


5) What your code files are and what each one of them does. (Please do not repeat the
project description, just name your code files, and briefly mention what they do).
Makefile: 
- make all: compiles and runs servemain.cpp, serverA.cpp, serverB.cpp and serverC.cpp
- make clean: removes servermain, serverA, serverB and serverC files
- make server: compiles and runs only servermain.cpp
- make serverA: compiles and runs only serverA.cpp
- make serverB: compiles and runs only serverA.cpp
- make serverC: compiles and runs only serverA.cpp
servermain.cpp:
- sendTo()
- trim()
- split()
- main()
serverA.cpp:
- trim()
- split()
- loadFile()
- main()
serverB.cpp:
- trim()
- split()
- loadFile()
- main()
serverC.cpp:
- trim()
- split()
- loadFile()
- main()


6) The format of all the messages exchanged.
- All communication occurs over UDP sockets using the following port numbers:
Main Server -> 33619
Game Server A -> 30619
Game Server B -> 31619
Game Server C -> 32619
- Messages are sent and received in plain text with no extra spaces, newlines, or trailing commas.
- Each message sent by the Main Server expects exactly one response from the corresponding Game Server.
- If any message format is incorrect or missing required data, the receiving server may ignore it or send back an error response.

7) Any idiosyncrasy of your project. It should say under what conditions the project
fails, if any.
- This project assumes that all input files and network messages strictly follow the specified formats. If any file 
(like dataA.txt, dataB.txt, or dataC.txt) is missing, incorrectly formatted, or contains extra spaces or missing commas, the servers may 
fail to parse the data correctly and produce unexpected results.
- If the main server or any game server is not started in the correct order or if one of the servers is not running, the UDP messages 
will not be received, and the program may appear to hang waiting for a response.
- The project also assumes that all player names are unique and that players only appear in their assigned game server’s data file. If a 
client sends an invalid player name, the main server simply prints an error but does not crash.

8) Reused Code: Did you use code from anywhere for your project? If not, say so. If
so, say what functions and where they're from. (Also identify this with a comment in
the source code.
